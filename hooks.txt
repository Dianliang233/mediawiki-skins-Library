Hooks provided by the Library skin.

'LibraryAfterToolbox': Called after rendering the toolbox portlet (#p-tb).
You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit counter, for example)
from an extension.
This is the Library counterpart to the MonoBookAfterToolbox hook in the MonoBook
skin.

'LibraryBeforeFooter': Called before the footer (#footer) is output, but after
#mw-navigation has been closed.
You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit counter, for example)
from an extension.
